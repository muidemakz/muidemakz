      <h1>UI/UX Case Study: Designing a quiz feature in an Educational App (Class Sensei)</h1>
      <p><strong>By - </strong><em>Excellent .O. Makanju </em><strong><em><u>23-03-2019</u></em></strong></p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>It’s a widely known occurrence that students don’t like STEM subjects such as Maths, Sciences, and
        Technological Course. Most of these students go into college and have to shuttle through College barely
        because
        the foundation wasn’t laid properly and most of them eventually end up taking Social Science courses or Art
        because they find it easy to learn and scale over.
        This happens a lot with teenagers who are just starting to figure out what path they want to follow as they
        slowly advance towards College. This is what gave birth to my App “Class Sensei”.
        The idea was to create an Educational App that would help students study better and hence, Class Sensei was
        created.
        Class Sensei is an Educational App where Students between the ages of 13–19 can come to and thoroughly learn
        Mathematics with as much fun as possible.</p>
      <h2>THE PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
      <P>The task was to create an Educational App for Teens on a STEM Subject but after research, I realized the real
        problem I wanted to solve was: How might we make STEM courses learnable for teens?</P>

        <figcaption>Flow of creative process</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
      <p>My primary target audience was students who don’t like STEM subjects especially Mathematics. The level at which
        students drop out has become quite alarming and I saw it as an opportunity to improve the statistics. But it’s a
        broad audience. I needed to trim it down so I could make more impact in their lives.
        I was now done with empathy, so I administered questionnaires to my neighbors, my family and friends’ children
        to give me an idea of why they like mathematics and if not what they think could help them better learn it.</p>
      <figure class="fig">
        <img img alt="Post Image" id="image" src="./Assets/BlogPic-2.png">
        <figcaption>A mock-up of class sensei</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I collated the feedback from the questionnaire and got some helpful insights from them.
        My target audience and focus have now shifted to concentrate on teenagers who don’t like mathematics. And I
        discovered that a mobile app would be the perfect tool.
        I found out that most of them didn’t like there Maths teacher and they associated it to why they didn’t like
        Maths and so that gave me an Idea.
        To create a likable Mathematics Teacher.</p>

      <h2>DEVELOPING MY SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>After collating my Questionnaire results.
        I also spoke/interviewed some adults on their understanding of Mathematics as they were growing up and they
        spoke on some of their pressure points.
        With both the questionnaire results and interviews concluded. I now had enough information to come up with a
        solution.
        I now needed to isolate the various problems to enable me to come up with a specific solution.
        So I then drew an Empathy Map to help me make an informed decision.
        From the response, I came up with a PERSONA, Dojo Dummy, 15 years old, just finished JSS3 and preparing to
        resume SS1 where they concentrate on either Sciences, Social Science or Arts. He is very impatient. Also
        extroverted. He doesn’t like being idle.
        With all the research data I already had, I started to ideate my designs. The first thing I did was to create a
        user flow for the app. I also set up a mood board to help me streamline my design options and then I created a
        wireframe to give me an idea of what I wanted the design to look like.
      </p>
      <h2><em>HOW I VALIDATED MY SOLUTION</em></h2>
      <P>Once I was done with all the research and wireframes. I designed a working prototype.
        I sent a link to some of the neighbors, family and friends children. I asked them to tell me what they thought
        and their feedback helped me fine-tune the prototype and made it ready to test with the Target Audience.
        I gave a few random teenagers to check and they loved it.
        Especially the Quiz feature.
        They liked challenging The Sensei and surprisingly it boosted their confidence in their respective Maths class
        in School.
        Still waiting for their results at the end of their Summer Lessons as proof.

          <h3><u>Excellent .O. Makanju</u></h3>
          <p>I specialize in creating beautiful, yet functional designs and simplistic user flow. I have a
            skill set that includes visual design and UX research.</p>
          I am a very passionate designer that always wants to grow, learn and try something new. I love what
          I do and I work exceptionally hard with who I work with.
          <p> I have over a year of experience in product design and specialize in UI/UX designs. Much of my
            experience comes from working for Canary Nigeria. I was their Art director.
            I also worked with Culbeed Media where I handled UI/UX designs for some of their clients. I'd be
            happy to provide you with links so that you can review before making a hiring decision.</p>
          <p>I am very comfortable using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After effects, Adobe XD
            and Figma for my designs.</p>
